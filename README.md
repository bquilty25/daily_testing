# Quarantine and testing strategies in contact tracing for SARS-CoV-2

The main script to run the analysis is `pcr_test_trace.R`. Set a name for your results in `results_name` and then run the rest of the script. Your results will be returned as a list of data frames for each scenario you have run (defined in `parameters.R`) and saved as a `.fst` in `/results/"results_name"`.

Figures in the main text can be generated by running `relative_results.R` , and supplementary figures can be generated by running `absolute_results.R`
